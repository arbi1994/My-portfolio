introduction: This is a website I made for a local business showcasing all the information requested by the client such as Menus, Meals pictures, Contacts, and Review providers. 
idea: Based on my client requests and the business itself, which is a local café, I wanted to present the website in the easiest way possible. Considering that its customers are mostly old people, I wanted to implement an intuitive and easy to access UI/UX, resembling as much as I could the cosy and friendly environment of the café by also matching up some of the colours that best suit this business.

summary: This project taught me how to communicate with a client, set deadlines and most importantly respect the deadlines.
