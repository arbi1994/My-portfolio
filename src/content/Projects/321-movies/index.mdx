introduction: This is a web application made with the purpose of showing the latest updated information about movies of all genres. It also provides the user with all the BUY, RENT and/or STREAMING services based on their country of preference.
idea: The idea behind comes from the love I have for movies in general. The main goal was being able to provide all the essential information with an ease of access and use, by implementing the main functionalities that the regular user is looking for. The UI is clean and concise, putting the accessibility in first place. All this has been achieved by conducting in-depth research and getting inspired by websites such as Just Watch, Binge, Imdb etc.

summary: At the end of this project, I have learnt how to deal with APIs, and fetch any sort of data by performing asynchronous HTTP requests. As this project included many functionalities, Iâ€™ve opted to use a production ready library/framework such as React. In this way, I learned how to structure my frontend with React, more specifically using the boilerplate Create React App, and how to use some of its hooks and some third-party libraries to improve the performance and load of the data. One of the techniques I used to improve the loading speed is Lazy Loading. Another important one, especially for mobile users, is Debouncing, which I had to implement in the Search Bar component, so that the after each input there is a waiting time of less than a second before an HTTP request has been send. This technique reduces unwanted mobile data to be consumed and improves the User Experience.
